# Introduction to server administration on Linux servers
Linux Server Administration Course @ ENSTA Bretagne in 2A (CSN)

This project was about using a Virtual Machine tool like Oracle VirtualBox and be used to administrate a simple Linux server with a simple web server.
We learned useful commands on Linux and made a simple bash script to run commands periodically.
Moreover, we trained on managing a reverse proxy using Nginx and making logs of the web server.

This was a fun project and I learnt a lot while practicing my knowledges.
